# Chapter 1. Python Primer - Exercises (Reinforcement 1-12, Creativity 13-28, Projects 29-36)

''' 1 Write a short Python function, is multiple(n, m), that takes two integer
values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some
integer i, and False otherwise.'''

# solution: 

Def mutiple(n,m):           # m,n is integer
  if m % n == 0: 
      Return True
  else:
      Return False


''' 2 Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an integer value and
returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function
cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators. '''

# solution:


'''3 Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of
one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the
form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions min or
max in implementing your solution.'''
